# Welcome to Virtual Target Practice!

##### Developed By: [Charlie Vukovic](https://github.com/cavukovic) and [Dylan Roig](https://github.com/dylanroig23)

Virtual target practice is an interactive first person shooter that offers a player the chance to play against the clock as they seek 
targets that are placed throughout an apartment themed map. BUT BEWARE! There is a boss character that will be waiting for you in the 
last room of the map who must be defeated in order to win the game.
